Q(1): Do you receive public assistance?
A: Yes
	Q(1.1):GOTO:qualaid
A: No
	Q(house): How many people are in your household?
	X:number
		Q(income): How much income does your household bring in per year in after tax dollars?
		X[javascript:if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),125)){ goto('qual') } else if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),218)) { goto('noqualbut') } else { goto('noqual') } ]:number
Q(qualaid): You probably qualify as indigent because you receive public assistance. See <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/rules-of-court/sjc/sjc310.html" target=_new>SJC Rule 3:10</a> and <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleVI/Chapter261/Section27A" target=_new>M.G.L. Chapter 261 MA Sec. 27A</a>.

Q(qual): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 125% of the poverty line. See <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleVI/Chapter261/Section27A" target=_new>M.G.L. Chapter 261 MA  27A</a>. Consequently, you may be eligible to have your court fees waived. Would you like me to open up a fee waiver for you to file?
A:[https://apps.suffolklitlab.org/start/indigency] Yes
	Q(3.1): If the affidavit of indigency didn't open in a new window/tab, you can find it <a href="https://apps.suffolklitlab.org/start/indigency">here</a>.
A: No
	Q(3.2):GOTO:nomore

Q(qualbut): You probably qualify as indigent but able to contribute since you earn between 125% and 218% of the poverty line. So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer and asked to pay a small fee. See <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/rules-of-court/sjc/sjc310.html" target=_new>SJC Rule 3:10</a>.

Q(noqual): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 125% of the poverty line. See <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleVI/Chapter261/Section27A" target=_new>M.G.L. Chapter 261 MA Sec. 27A</a>. So you'll probably need to hire an attorney. Would you like to search for one near you?
A:[https://www.avvo.com/find-a-lawyer] Yes.
	Q(5.1):GOTO:nomore
A: No
	Q(5.2):GOTO:nomore

Q(nomore): I'm afraid there's nothing else I can help you with. I hope you have a nice day.
